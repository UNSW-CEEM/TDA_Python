Tariff Design and Analysis (TDA) tool is developed by Centre for Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM), at the University of New South Wales, funded by Energy Consumers Australia. The open source TDA tool aims to assist stakeholders to investigate how different tariff structures impact on the expected bills of different types of residential consumers.
